# SMACT Practical
A series of computational experiments using the open-source Python package [SMACT](https://github.com/WMD-group/smact).

### Requirements
The practicals are written in iPython notebook, which is included with standard Python distributions such as [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and the [Homebrew Superpack for Mac](http://stronginference.com/ScipySuperpack/).

### Background
There is a strong demand for new functional materials across a wide range of technologies. The purposes can include cost reduction, performance enhancement, or to enable a new application. 

The problem is that the number of *possible* materials is infinite, when multi-component systems are considered. The challenge for materials scientists is to navigate the phase space as efficiently as possible. We have collected an extended reading list around this topic on [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/groups/8113991/materials-design/overview/). 

Data collections such as the [Materials Project](https://www.materialsproject.org), [NREL Materials Database](http://materials.nrel.gov) and the [Open Quantum Materials Database](http://oqmd.org) are valuable resources, but they cover the properties of *known* compounds as calculated using high-level quantum mechanical theories.

We have been developing a low-cost procedure for screening hypothetical materials in the [SMACT](https://github.com/WMD-group/SMACT) package. These tutorials show how this framework can be used for simple calculations on your own computer.
